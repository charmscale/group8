	<h1 class="heading">A Brief History of Anime</h1>
	<div class=main>
		<h2 class=paragraph>Anime is the Japanese word for the English word “animation”. In the western world, it is <br> a word commonly used to refer to Japanese-produced animations, while in the native <br>Japanese language, it is used as a blanket term to denote all forms of animation regardless <br>of country of origin. This website will specifically cover the English definition of the word <br>anime.<br>
			<br> While it has existed from as early as 1917, it has been popularized in recent years <br>after the end of World War II with the spread of televisions in Japan allowing for wider and <br>broader appeal of animated entertainment; particularly with the animated adaptation of <br>Osamu Tezuka’s <i>Tetsuwan Atom</i> (eventually localized in the west as <i>Astro Boy</i>) manga (the <br>Japanese equivalent of comic books) for weekly television broadcasts in the 1960s. Tezuka’s <br>art style influenced by Walt Disney’s cartoon art style, particularly of Scrooge McDuck was <br>a pioneer of what would eventually become the <i>anime</i> art style. <br>
			<br>While popular domestically, anime was rather niche and unknown to the west until <br>the 1990s that appealed primarily to specific animation enthusiasts. Because there was <br>limited access to the internet back then, there was no fast way to obtain information or <br>even footage of these animations overseas outside of importing VHS tapes. Around the late <br>1990s, Japanese animations such as but not limited to those by the now-internationally <br>acclaimed Studio Ghibli led by Hayao Miyazaki with films such as <i>Princess Mononoke</i>, My <br><i>Neighbor Totoro</i> and <i>Nausicaa: Valley of the Wind</i>among others that appealed to not only <br>animation enthusiasts, but also children and family audiences. This was also around the <br>time period the international popularity of television-broadcast anime such as adaptations <br>of the <i>shonen</i> (boy’s) manga <i>Dragon Ball</i>, the <i>shoujo</i> (girl’s) manga <i>Sailor Moon</i>, and the <br>adaptation of the hit 1996 video game <i>Pokémon</i> started to rise, with them appealing to <br>children.<br>
			<br>With the rise of the internet enabling the fast spread of information and the <br>continued popularity of Japanese-produced media even outside of anime such as manga <br>and video games gaining emergence overseas over the years, anime continues to be <br>popular to this day with the barrier of entry being lowered, and the translations of these <br>shows into different language becoming those of a higher, more professional quality. While <br>anime may carry a negative connotation to those unfamiliar with the term alongside the <br>negative stereotypical image of an eccentric enthusiast of “nerdy” hobbies, this site aims to <br>educate the perhaps unfamiliar reader on anime, while allowing current fans of anime to <br>be able to use this site as a form of reference with its robust tools.
